Predicting customer outcome. 
Predicted if a customer will click buy or not on a website based on customer background and customer website navigation behavior information, 
compared the performance of various machine learning techniques (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Convolution Neural Networks, 
Random Forest, extreme gradient boosting algorithms) and obtained an accuracy of 93% for generalized linear model.
Data - Train.csv and Test.csv are the 2 data files used during the prediction. The output of the model is recorded in Submission.csv file which contains predictions.
